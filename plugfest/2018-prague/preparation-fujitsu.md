# Appendix A: Sequence diagrams specified in Fujitsu's proxy servients

Appendix A describes sequence diagram among application, remote / local proxies, and device servient implemented for this plugfest by Fujitsu.

This section shows sequence diagram and message formats exchange among servients which protocol is only HTTP to be used in this sequence. The remote and local proxies bridges with STUN for NAT traversal in this sequence.

### A1 Register
A device servient is registered to the local proxy servient and remote proxy servient. The proxy servient returned the TD with public URL. The proxy servients have TD repositories to store TDs registered from the other servients.

![images](images/seq_register.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

(1) HTTP POST http://lps.example.com/Things/register<BR>
Body: TD<BR>
(2) 201 Created<BR>

(3) (1) HTTP POST http://lps.example.com/Things/register<BR>
Body: TD<BR>

(4) 201 Created<BR>

## A2 Lookup
An application servient can lookup TDs registered the remote proxy servient with its URL. If the URL indicates the servient, it returns the list of the devices connected. If the URL specifies the devices registered on the proxy servient, it returns TD of it.

![images](images/seq_lookup.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

(11) HTTP GET http://rps.example.com/Things/<BR>
Body: none<BR>

(12) 200 OK<BR>
Body: list of registered things [FujitsuAirConditioner, PanasonicAirConditioner, …]<BR>

(13) HTTP GET http://rps.example.com/Things/deviceName<BR>
Body: none<BR>

(14) 200 OK<BR>
Body: TD

## A3 Read property
The application servient sends a request to read the value of the property of the device servient to the remote proxy servient. The remote and local proxy servient relay to this request to the device servient.

![images](images/seq_readproperty.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

The application gets a value of a certain property of the device servient. For this purpose, it gets the URL for the property from TD of the device servient.

(21) HTTP GET http://rps.example.com/lps1/Things/deviceName/Property/temperature<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The remote proxy gets the URL for the property from TD of the device servient registered in the repository. "glps.example.com" is global address which can be accessed from remote proxy.

(22) HTTP GET http://glps.example.com/Things/deviceName/Property/temperature<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The local proxy gets the URL for the property from TD of the device servient registered in the repository.

(23) HTTP GET http://192.169.1.2/Things/deviceName/Property/temperature<BR>
Body: none<BR>

(24) 200 OK<BR>
Body: 25(value)<BR>

(25) 200 OK<BR>
Body: 25(value)<BR>

(26) 200 OK<BR>
Body: 25(value)<BR>

## A4 Write property
The application servient sends a request to write the value to the property of the device servient to the remote proxy servient. The remote and local proxy servient relay to this request to the device servient.

![images](images/seq_writeproperty.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

The application puts a value of a certain property of the device servient. For this purpose, it gets the URL for the property from TD of the device servient.

(31) HTTP PUT http://rps.example.com/lps1/Things/deviceName/Property/status<BR>
Body: ON<BR>

The remote proxy puts the URL for the property from TD of the device servient registered in the repository.
"glps.example.com" is global address which can be accessed from remote proxy.

(32) HTTP PUT http://glps.example.com/Things/deviceName/Property/status<BR>
Body: ON<BR>

## A5 Subscribe and Event with Server Sent Event method
The application servient can obtain the change or the current status of the device servient via proxy servient using subscription procedures. The application servient sends a request to subscribe the property of the device servient via the remote and local proxy servient. The device servient keep to send the value of the specified property periodically.
Diagram A5 and A6 show the sequence diagarms for Subcribtion, Event handling, and Unsubscription for stopping event handling with using Server Sent Event method. 

![images](images/seq_subscribe.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

The application subscribes an event of the device servient to be periodically notified. The application gets URL for this event and send a request to the remote proxy servient.

(41) HTTP POST http://rps.example.com/lps1/Things/deviceName/Event/change<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The remote proxy gets the URL for the event from TD of the device servient registered in the repository.

(42) HTTP POST http://glps.example.com/Things/deviceName/Event/change<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The local proxy gets the URL for this event from TD of the device servient registered in the repository.

(43) HTTP POST http://192.169.1.2/Things/deviceName/Event/change<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The device servient sends a notify to the application via the local and remote proxy servient with Server Sent Events specified by W3C.  The device responses “200 OK” with a header “Context-Type: text/event-stream”.

(44)-(46) 200 OK<BR>
Context-Type:text/event-stream<BR>
Body: none<BR>

If this subscription succeeded, the events keep to be notified to the application via the local and remote proxy servients. This event is sent as chunk data.

(47)-(49) <BR>
Body: data:25(value)<BR>

## A6 Unsubscribe with Server Sent Event method
The application servient sends a request to unsubscribe to the remote proxy servient to stop to notify the event from the device servient.

![images](images/seq_unsubscribe.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

The application unsubscribes the event “change. The application deletes URL for this event and send a request to the remote proxy servient.

(51) HTTP DELETE http://rps.example.com/lps1/Things/deviceName/Event/change<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The remote proxy gets the URL for the event from TD of the device servient unregistered in the repository.

(52) HTTP DELETE http://glps.example.com/Things/deviceName/Event/change<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The local proxy gets the URL for this event from TD of the device servient unregistered in the repository.

(53) HTTP DELETE http://192.169.1.2/Things/deviceName/Event/change<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The device servient stops sending event and returns the response with “200 OK”.

(54)-(56) 200 OK<BR>
Body: none<BR>

### A7 Subbscribe and Event with Long Polliing method
Diagram A7 shows another implmentation for event handling with the Long Polling method.
The application servient sends a request to subscribe the property of the device servient to the remote proxy servient. The device servient keep to send the value of the specified property periodically or when some events happen until the application unsubscribes.


![images](images/seq_subscribe_longpolling.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

The application subscribes an event of the device servient to be notified. The application gets URI for this event and send a request to the remote proxy servient.

(41) HTTP GET http://rps.example.com/lps1/Things/deviceName/Poll/eventName
Body: none

The remote proxy gets the URI for the event from TD of the device servient registered in the repository.

(42) HTTP GET http://lps.example.com/Things/deviceName/Poll/eventName
Body: none

The local proxy gets the URI for this event from TD of the device servient registered in the repository.

(43) HTTP GET http://device.example.com/poll/device/changed
Body: none

The device servient doesn’t send a response immediately and keep this connection until an event happens. When the value of the property is changed, the device servient sends an event notification to the application via the local and remote proxy servient with Long Polling method. The device responses “200 OK” with a value.

(44)-(46) 200 OK
Body: value

This flow of step from (41) to (46) will be repeated during the application sending requests.
In this case, “Unsubscribe” message dose not exist. If the application servient stop the subscription, it stop to send the request (47).


### A8 Unregister
The device servient unregister from the local proxy servient before shutdown. The local proxy servient unregister this device servient from the remote proxy not to access from the application.

![images](images/seq_unregister.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

(61) HTTP DELETE http://lps.example.com/Things/deviceName<BR>
Body: none<BR>

(62) 200 OK<BR>
       Body:none<BR>

(63) HTTP POST http://rps.example.com/Things/deviceName<BR>
Body: none<BR>

(64) 200 OK<BR>
Body:none<BR>
