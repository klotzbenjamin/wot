# PlugFest Preparation for Online September 2018 - Intel

This document describes the preparations made by Intel for the Online PlugFest on Sept 25 to 28.

**FIRST DRAFT: Work in Progress**

Features marked with <i>italics</i> are work-in-progress, and hence not confirmed to be available during the PlugFest.

## 1 PlugFest Infrastructure
This section lists the infrastructure available for the PlugFest, which can be used for individual testing (see [Section 3.1](#31-testing-individually))


### 1.1 Public Thing Directories

Cloud Thing Directories
* [Thingweb-Directory](https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-directory) running at https://portal.mmccool.net:8090.
* [Thingweb-Directory](https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-directory) running at https://tiktok.mmccool.org:8090.
* [Authentication credentials]() - to be distributed via W3C email and/or use OAuth2

Local LAN Thing Directories (simulated local LANs using OpenVPN)
* [Thingweb-Directory](https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-directory) running at http://gateway.local:8090 on VLAN1.
* [Thingweb-Directory](https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-directory) running at http://gateway.local:8090 on VLAN2.
* No authentication credentials; assumes "local network" is secure.
* You need to authenticate via OpenVPN to access.

* See below: "local" thing directories are also made publically available by reverse proxies, but technically this is only for testing, and the VLAN should be used to connect to it as a local device.  Access via reverse proxies also requires authentication and use https rather than http.   However, note that the TDs returned may return URLs with IP addresses that are not visible from the public internet (being behind a "virtual NAT").

### 1.2 Public Proxies

[SimpleReverseProxy]() running at https://portal.mmccool.net
* Port xxxx: proxied access to OCF devices on VLAN1
* Port xxxx: proxied access to camera service on VLAN1
* Port xxxx: proxied access to speech service on VLAN1
* Port xxxx: proxied access to Thing Directory on VLAN1 (testing only)
    
[SimpleReverseProxy]() running at https://tiktok.mmccool.org
* Port xxxx: proxied access to OCF devices on VLAN2
* Port xxxx: proxied access to camera service on VLAN2
* Port xxxx: proxied access to speech service on VLAN2
* Port xxxx: proxied access to Thing Directory on VLAN2 (testing only)

### 1.3 Public Tools

OAuth2 
* OAuth2 Authentication server at https://portal.mmccool.net:6000.
* OAuth2 Authentication server at https://tiktok.mmccool.org:6000.
* [Authentication credentials]() - to be distributed via W3C email and/or use OAuth2

OpenVPN 
* OpenVPN server at https://portal.mmccool.net:9010 (VLAN1).
* OpenVPN server at https://tiktok.mmccool.org:9010 (VLAN2).
* [Authentication credentials]() - to be distributed via W3C email and/or use OAuth2

Validation
* [Thingweb Playground](https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-playground) running at https://portal.mmccool.net:10000.
* [Thingweb Playground](https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-playground) running at https://tiktok.mmccool.org:10000.

## 3 Checking points for the next plugfest

### 3.1 Testing Individually
The following checking points can be completed by the participant alone by using the PlugFest infrastructure (TD Playground, Thing Directory, Proxies).

#### 3.1.1 Validate TDs

* Intel will validate all TDs using [Thingweb Playground](https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-playground).

#### 3.1.2 Register with Thing Directory

* Intel will register all TDs dynamically with all Thing Directories listed above, using a 1 minute timeout.
* Intel will also capture all TDs and [archive them](github.org/w3c/wot/plugfest/2018-sept-online/TDs/Intel).

#### 3.1.3 Connect with Remote/Local Proxy

* Intel will proxy all local Things through reverse ssh proxies as noted above

#### 3.1.4 Connect with node-wot

* Intel will test consumption of all of Intel's TDs using node-wot

#### 3.1.5 Scripting API

* Intel will be running some simple application servients using node-wot both on the local gateway and in the cloud, and will attempt connection to both local (within-VLAN) and remote (via proxy) Things.

### 3.2 Testing in Client Role
The following checking points must be completed together with a partner in server role.

#### 3.2.1 Metadata Handling

* Intel will manually check client role using Postman and/or curl (HTTP only) 
* Intel will check client role using node-wot for both CoAP (OCF devices) and HTTP(S).

#### 3.2.2 Read Property

##### HTTP

* YES - Postman, curl, node-wot
