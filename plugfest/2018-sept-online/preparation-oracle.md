## 3 Checking points for the next plugfest

### 3.1 Testing Individually
The following checking points can be completed by the participant alone by using the PlugFest infrastructure (TD Playground, Thing Directory, Proxies).

#### 3.1.1 Validate TDs

* Oracle will validate all TDs of plug fest participants and will create simulated devices in the Digital Twin Simulator.

#### 3.1.2 Register with Thing Directory

* Oracle will generate TDs of simulated devices which can be registered with Thing Directories provided by other companies.
  These devices can be used via node-WoT or the Fujitsu proxy.

#### 3.1.3 Connect with Remote/Local Proxy

* The Oracle IoT Cloud service has already been integrated into the Fujitsu proxy for the Bundang Plugfest.

#### 3.1.4 Connect with node-wot

* The Oracle IoT Cloud service has already been integrated into node-wot for the Prague Plugfest.

## 4 Use cases

Oracle intends to address a home integration and industrial integration scenarios to 
demonstrate the benefits of an interoperable Web of Things ecosystem.

The two scenarios were already presented at the last day of the Bundang Plugfest:
https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/images/e/ed/WoT_adoption.pptx

These scenarios will be implemented by a combination of simulated and real physical devices.
Where a real device integration is not available, we intend to create a simulation 
based on the TD of that device.
 
## Home integration scenario

Scenario: Automatically turn off devices when user leaves the room  

### Description: 
The KETI environment sensor is capable of identifying when a room is empty by measuring the oxygen level.
When the "room empty" condition is detected by the Oracle IoT-Cloud Service Asset Monitoring application,
the room is cleaned by a vacuum cleaner, the lights are turned off, window blinds are closed and 
a survceillence camera is turned on.

### Device interactions
- Monitor room occupancy (KETI Sensor)  
- Detect when room is empty and trigger the following actions (Oracle)
- Close window blinds (Fujitu)
- Clean the room (Panasonic)
- Turn on a MQTT device (Siemens)
- Turn off the lights (Smart Things)
- Turn on a surveillance camera (Intel)
- Control other devices (Hitachi)

## Industrial integration scenario

Scenario: Automatically alert and protect citizens when a chemical plant has an accident

### Description
The KETI environment sensor is capable of measuring air quality by measuring the oxygen level.
When a low oxygen condition is detected by the Oracle IoT-Cloud Service Asset Monitoring application,
connected devices take the appropriate action to protect and alert citizens,
such as draining a tank in the factory, turning off all air-conditioners, flash alert and warning lights,
pubish alert messages and make voice announcements.

### Device interactions
- Monitor environment condition in multiple locations (KETI-sensors)
- Discover anomaly, critical condition and trigger the following actions (Oracle)
- Drain the tank in a chemical factory (Siemens)
- Flash a warning light (Fujitsu)
- Turn off all air conditioners (Panasonic)
- Flash the lights (Smart Things)
- Make voice announcements (Intel)
- Broadcast an alert message (Hitachi)



## 5 Requirements for PlugFest Environment

| Participant | Number of People | Number of Power outlets | Network                     | Remarks |
