## Target Features
* Security
    - All devices should support secure access
    - Test all schemes and protocol combinations
      in [security best practices](https://github.com/w3c/wot-security/blob/master/wot-security-best-practices.md)
    - Definitions
* Action and event patterns
   - Input and output data for actions
   - Event subscription and cancellation
   - Action and event descriptions (at least one implementation)
* Semantics
   - Exercise iotschema.org to achieve interoperability in scenarios below
* Protocol Bindings
   - URI Templates

## Out of Scope Features (Defer until Lyon)

## Testing
* Demonstrate WoT interoperability across products for different domains:
   - Interoperability scenario for industrial IoT
   - Interoperability scenario for home IoT  
* Functional Test Development

# Scenarios

The following scenarios validate the interoperability of devices across different manufactuers.

Note: we may want to define some smaller, simpler scenarios for testing; but we also need a "meaty" scenario for demonstration
purposes at TPAC.

## Home integration scenarios

Scenario 1: Automatically turn off devices when user leaves the room  

### Description:
The KETI environment sensor is capable of identifying when a room is empty by measuring the oxygen level.
When the "room empty" condition is detected by the Oracle IoT-Cloud Service Asset Monitoring application,
the room is cleaned by a vacuum cleaner, the lights are turned off, window blinds are closed and
a survceillence camera is turned on.

### Device interactions
- Monitor room occupancy (KETI Sensor)  
- Detect when room is empty and trigger the following actions (Oracle)
- Close window blinds (Fujitu)
- Clean the room (Panasonic)
- Turn on a MQTT device (Siemens)
- Turn off the lights (Smart Things)
- Turn on a surveillance camera (Intel)
- Control other devices (Hitachi)

## Industrial integration scenarios

Scenario 1: Automatically alert and protect citizens when a chemical plant has an accident

### Description
The KETI environment sensor is capable of measuring air quality by measuring the oxygen level.
When a low oxygen condition is detected by the Oracle IoT-Cloud Service Asset Monitoring application,
connected devices take the appropriate action to protect and alert citizens,
such as draining a tank in the factory, turning off all air-conditioners, flash alert and warning lights,
pubish alert messages and make voice announcements.

### Device interactions
- Monitor environment condition in multiple locations (KETI-sensors)
- Discover anomaly, critical condition and trigger the following actions (Oracle)
- Drain the tank in a chemical factory (Siemens)
- Flash a warning light (Fujitsu)
- Turn off all air conditioners (Panasonic)
- Flash the lights (Smart Things)
- Make voice announcements (Intel)
- Broadcast an alert message (Hitachi)

## Possible Future Scenarios: 
# Enterprise integration scenarios
Ex: Access control and security system
Ex: Energy management in a smart building/smart city
# Transportation scenarios
Ex: Fleet management
Ex: Shipping and inventory control (supply chain management)

# Logistics

* Oracle IoT Cloud Service Instance  
  Like in the previous plug fests there is an instance of the Oracle IoT Cloud Service available for interoperability tests.  
  It is shared among all plug fest participants, so please coordinate with Michael.Lagally@oracle.com if you have questions.  
  The management console is available at:
  https://129.150.200.242/ui  
  The instance is using the same password, as previously communicated to individual companies. Please let Michael.Lagally@oracle.com know if you require access.
  
* Oracle Digital Twin Simulator  
  There is an instance of the Oracle Digital Twin Simulator for plug fest participants. It hosts several simulations, such as a HVAC, Pump, Truck, Connected Car. Instances of simulated devices can be provided for plug fest participants on request.  
  Please let Michael.Lagally@oracle.com know if you require a simulated device instance.  
  The login page is at:
https://129.150.200.242/ds

* OpenVPN servers (McCool)
   - Running on DigitalOcean instances in Frankfurt
   - Addresses are 
       - vlan1.mmccool.net (should be at 104.248.39.149) port 1194 (udp) - TUN
       - vlan2.mmccool.net (should be at 104.248.39.147) port 1194 (udp) - TAP
   - If you want VPN access please send an email to michael.mccool@intel.com
       - Indicate how many machines you will connect
       - I will send a `<config>.ovpn` file, where `<config>` will be a unique name for your device
   - To install openvpn client on Linux (see Digital Ocean link below for more info):
     ```
     sudo apt-get install openvpn
     ```
   - To run manually after installation:
     List the files in '/etc/openvpn'; if `update-resolve-conf` exists, edit the `<config>.ovpn` file
     and uncomment the three lines starting with `script-security`.  Save.
     Whenever you need to start the VPN, issue the following command,
     ```
     sudo openvpn <config>.ovpn
     ```
     where `<config>` should be replaced with the unique name for your device.
     Now look at output of `ifconfig`: you should see a new network, and the default gateway should
     be redirected so it is used automatically.
     To stop the VPN simply kill the above program.
   - To run as a service that starts automatically at boot
     First, edit the config file as above.  Then issue
     ```
     sudo cp <config>.ovpn /etc/openvpn/<config>.conf
     sudo systemctl start openvpn@<config>
     sudo systemctl enable openvpn@<config>
     ```
     where `<config>` should be replaced with the name of your config file, which is
     unique for each device on the network.  
     The VPN will be started and will start automatically at boot (note though that your IP may
     vary).
     To check the status, issue
     ```
     sudo tail -f /var/log/openvpn/openvpn.log
     ```
     You might have to create the directory first...
      ```
     sudo mkdir /var/log/openvpn
     ```
   - Details:
       - Only port 1194/UDP is supported for now 
       - If people have a firewall that blocks this, let me know and I can set up a 443/TCP server
       - VLAN1 and VLAN2 are intentionally separate networks.  
       - VLAN1 uses TUN, VLAN2 uses TAP
       - Only TAP can be bridged to an external network
       - They are both connected to the 
         internet via a one-way NAT (all outgoing traffic is permitted, no incoming traffic)
   - The TUN setup mostly follows this configuration from Digital Ocean:
       - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-18-04 
       - Note these are TUN (IP) networks and does not provide DCHP, mDNS, ARP discovery, etc
       - In practice this means you need to know the IP address of the device you wish to connect
       - Also, currently IP addresses may change each time you restart the VPN client on a device
       - You also have to run an OpenVPN client on each device you connect
    - The TAP setup is a modification of the above
       - And so not as well tested
    - Tweaks
       - Comments out the "user" and "group" lines in the config files to make teardown cleaner
* VPN Bridge (WIP; McCool)
   - Physical bridge to connect local network to VPN using hardware with multiple physical interfaces
   - Needs a TAP (ethernet VPN), not TUN... 
   - Should allow use of devices unable to run an OpenVPN client themselves; ideally, just need to run on a "router" 
   - Something like this, using hostapd: https://askubuntu.com/questions/926116/share-my-vpn-connection-with-other-lan-users
* Oauth2 server (WIP; McCool)
   - Plan is to use the following: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-oauth2-server
   - Server to be at auth.mmccool.net
