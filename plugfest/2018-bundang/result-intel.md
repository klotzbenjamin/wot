# 2. Next plugfest

This section describes the Bundang plugfest held on June 30 and July 1.

## 2.1 Participants and Servients

This table is not 100% complete, as it does not describe all the services
running on the gateways or cloud servers, yet.

To augment the table below, here is an architectural drawing.  The arrows are
colored as follows: red - insecure HTTP/TCP; green - secure HTTPS/TLS (encrypted, authenticated),
blue - CoAP/UDP (currently insecure).

![Intel WoT Plugfest - Architecture](images/Intel_Architecture_Bundang.svg)

Devices being brought to plugfest:
1. 1x Sensor Node.
    - Supporting physical OCF Smart Home Demo sensors.
2. 1x UP Core
    - Web Speech.   
    - Simple Web Camera   
3. 1x UP Squared Gateway   
    - IoT REST API Server
    - OCF Metadata Translator
    - Thing Directory
    - Thing Validator
    - SSH Reverse Tunnel "callers" (call into cloud servers to bypass NAT)
    - OCF Smart Home simulated devices
    - Application servient(s) (node-wot)

Devices remaining in the lab but accessible remotely over the network:
1. 2x Sensor Node.
    - Supporting physical OCF Smart Home Demo sensors.
2. 1x UP Core
    - Web Speech.   
    - Simple Web Camera   
3. 1x UP Squared Gateway   
    - IoT REST API Server
    - OCF Metadata Translator
    - Thing Directory
    - Thing Validator
    - SSH Reverse Tunnel "callers" (call into cloud servers to bypass NAT)
    - OCF Smart Home simulated devices
    - Application servient(s) (node-wot)
4. FOSCAM IP Camera
    - tilt/pan, zoom, streaming, night vision, and speaker/microphone
    - REST API + WS, made available via cloud proxy
5. Power Management
    - so all devices can be power-cycled
    - REST API made available via cloud proxy
6. Remote Lamp
    - to provide light for the camera when it is night in Japan
    - the camera can function using only IR, but then color is not available
7. Power cycling control of network bridges
    - via a backup network

Devices 1 and 2 will have TDs.  Devices 4 and 5 have REST APIs, and (time
permitting) *may* be set up
with TDs describing a subset of their services (but note that power-cycling the 
gateway may disrupt other services!  I may set up one port with a light though
so operating on it can be observed via the FOSCAM camera).
Device 6 and 7 are available via Sonoff
devices which have a proprietary service to control them (not accessible to WoT,
at least not yet).

Here is a preview of the images that that will be available of the lab via
the FOSCAM:

## 2.2 Checking points for the next plugfest

These were described in result.md in the Prague plugfest.

### (1) Connect with remote/local proxy
Accomplished as described in the preparation document.

### (2) Application servients

A single application servient will be written using node-woti.
It will consume Thing Descriptions for a sensor and an actuator and tie one to the other.
It can be used to test the coordination of multiple devices in simple scenarios.
We will investigate scenarios that involve coordinating local-local, local-cloud, and local-remote (behind a separate NAT) devices.

For example, this servient could be used to map an Event or change of state on a sensor, such as a button being pushed,
to change of state in an actuator, such as turning a light on.   This servient can be run locally (in which case it is a simple switch
allowing a light to be turned on) or using devices remote from each other (in which case the light can act as a notifier for the
event).  The initial setup will use a simple button but the same servient could be mapped to other input and output devices
from other participants during testing.  Initial implementation will use Observe/Long Polling rather than true Events
but will be upgraded during the plugfest to WS or SSE events if possible.

### (3) Connect with node-wot

Yes.  See 2.

### (4) Scripting API

Yes, to implement the behaviour in 2.

### (5) Thing Directory operation

Yes, using thingweb, running both local and remote instances.  In fact there will
be two cloud services and two gateways.  The gateways will be behind two different
NATs and the cloud services will have two separate base URLs (but will point to the same
set of devices behind both NATs).

We will be exploring various strategies to coordinate multiple Thing Directories
and manipulate Thing Descriptions appropriately (eg modifying the base URIs).

### (6) Device Servients

The Web Speech and Web Camera are simple endpoint devices that do have TDs but do not
consume other TDs or use node-wot in their implementation.

In addition, time permitting, a simple "device" endpoint will also be implemented using
node-wot.

### (7) Device simulators

In addition to the physical OCF devices, a set of simulated devices running on both
gateways will be available.

### (8) Semantic integration

All TDs will use semantic annotations drawn from iotschema.  In the case of OCF devices
these annotations will be based on a mapping of capabilities from OCF's resource type system.

The various Thing Directories will then provide semantic searches.  Time permitting,
integration with an AVS (AWS Voice Service) using semantic searches to find appropriate
device affordances will be attempted.

### (9) Security

All remote accesses will be protected by HTTPS and either (that is, both, on different ports)
Basic Authentication or Digest Authentication.  Time permitting, additional forms of
authentication may be attempted (eg OAuth).

Local protection will be by HTTPS using self-signed certs or via SSH tunnels.  Time permitting,
the (new) CoAPS ACL features of IoTivity may be activated and tested.

### (10) Accessibility

The simple servient noted above will still allow various accessibility scenarios to be
explored.  For example, turning on a light could also be extended to trigger a voice
notification.

### (11) Event handling

Long polling is supported by the Simple Web Camera.  Time permitting, true event notification
mechanisms may be supported.

## 2.3 Other issues

The following points are picked up from Koster-san's material.

### (1) Validate the simplified TD

The updated TD playground will be running *as a service* on the two cloud servers and the two gateways and 
support validation of the new TD.  An option will be provided to validate TDs before submitting them
to the Thing Directories.

### (2) Extended Actions

The Web Speech system currently uses a "long response": the request to speak does not return until the
speech is complete.  Time permitting, implementing one of the recommended new patterns for monitoring and cancelling
actions may be attempted.

### (3) Notification - websockets, webhooks

Time permitting, more advanced patterns supporting true Events may be added to one of the
existing services.

### (4) Discovery using Feature of Interest annotation

These annotations can be added although it should be noted that we haven't yet solved the
problem of validating TDs using diverse external vocabularies so it may be necessary to
bypass validation when registering TDs using experimental vocabularies with the Thing Directories.

### (5) Application Scenarios, recipes

Just going to explore simple stimulus-response application patterns for now, but will
focus on doing so securely while traversing multiple NATs and the internet.

### (6) Proxy integration with Thing Directory

We have our own proxy system but will attempt to register with other proxy services
if they are available.

### (7) New security patterns

In addition to Basic and Digest, OAuth authentication will be attempted, time permitting.

### (8) Test Framework

Will submit devices and TDs to a test service, if it is available.

### (9) Other

As noted above, the setup will support NAT-cloud-NAT scenarios. 

## 2.3 Use cases

1. Remote alarms
2. Accessibility (translating events into notifications in different sensory modalities)
3. Environmental sensing (how's the temperature in my lab in Japan?)

# 3 Schedule

Sat 30.6.18:  9:00-18:00  
Sun 1.7.18:  9:00-18:00  

Venue: TTA

# 4 Requirements for PlugFest Setting

| Participant | Number of Participants | Number of Power outlets | Network | Remarks |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------|---------|
| Intel       | 1                      | 1                       | Wi-Fi and/or wired Ethernet | External ports: 22, 80, 443. Will bring own router and power bar.   |

# 5 Implementation guidelines

The "name" field of Thing Description shall be of the following form: "IntelDeviceNumberLocation", where
Location will be one of "Local" (at the Plugfest) or "Remote" (in the remote lab).  Number will be
used to distinguish multiple copies of the same kind of device (the sensor nodes are mostly duplicates
of each other).  The Number will always be at least 1 even if there is only one instance of that kind of device.

Examples:
  * IntelRGB2Remote
  * IntelButton1Local
  * IntelSpeech1Remote
  * IntelCamera1Local
  * IntelFOSCAM1Remote
