### 3.2 Testing in Client Role
The following checking points must be completed together with a partner in server role.

#### 3.2.1 Metadata Handling

* Hitachi: incorporate Metadata in Node-RED contexts or messages.
  - Our implementation uses label/description for Node-RED editor UI.
  - Use of semantic metadata ("iot:...", etc.) is future work.

#### 3.2.2 Property Handling -- was part of (2)

* Hitachi: checked following bindings
  * Get bindings: HTTP(S)
  * Set bindings: HTTP(S)
  * Observe bindings: HTTP(S)+Longpoll

#### 3.2.3 Action Handling -- was part of (2)

* Hitachi: checked following bindings
   * Invoke: HTTP(S)

#### 3.2.4 Event Handling -- was part of (11)

* Hitachi:  following bindings
   * Subscribe: HTTP(S)+Longpoll

#### 3.2.5 Security -- was part of (9)

* Hitachi: our client consume following Security Schemes:
   * basic
   * digest
   * bearer
   * We need security metadata to designate HTTP header name for API key
     - Panasonic's simulator uses "X-PWOT-TOKEN" header.
     - for example, OpenAPI 3.0 uses following security metadata (see https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/ )
```yaml
  securitySchemes:
    ApiKeyAuth:        # arbitrary name for the security scheme
      type: apiKey
      in: header       # can be "header", "query" or "cookie"
      name: X-API-KEY  # name of the header, query parameter or cookie
```

* Hitachi: N/A

#### 3.2.7 Accessibility -- was (10)

* Hitachi: N/A

### 3.3 Testing in Server Role

* Hitachi: N/A

#### 3.4.2 Discovery using Feature of Interest -- was Other Issues (4)

* Hitachi: N/A

#### 3.4.3 New Security Patterns -- was Other Issues (7)

* Hitachi: N/A

#### 3.4.4 Miscellaneous -- was Other Issues (9)

* Hitachi: N/A

### 7.1 Servient operations
#### 7.1.1 Property handling
#### 7.1.2 Event handling
#### 7.1.3 Action handling
#### 7.1.4 Thing directory handling
#### 7.1.5 Metadata handling

### 7.3 Implementaion aspect
#### 7.3.1 Application Servients
- There are some ambiguity in the interpretation of TD
  - How to select most suitable access method from multiple form entries?
- Ease of adoption from existing IoT tool (such as Node-RED), Cloud service (Oracle/AWS/GCP/Azure/etc.)
  is important aspect of Web of Things.
  - add a description of "Legacy IoT Tool/Service" in Architecture document (in Chapter 7)?
#### Â 7.3.2 Device Servients
#### 7.3.3 Node-wot as a servient
#### 7.3.4 Scripting API implementation
#### 7.3.5 Device simulators, Test framework

### 7.4 Others

#### 7.4.2 Security (API Keys, etc.)
- We need security metadata for designate HTTP header name for API key
  - Panasonic's simulator uses "X-PWOT-TOKEN" header.
  - for example, OpenAPI 3.0 uses following security metadata (see https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/ )
```yaml
  securitySchemes:
    ApiKeyAuth:        # arbitrary name for the security scheme

#### 7.4.3 Accessibility

## Appendix.  Implementation of our application servient

We implemented "Node generator for Node-RED (Web of Things version)",
extending an existing OSS "[node-red-nodegen](https://github.com/node-red/node-red-nodegen)".

![Node generator for Node-RED (Web of Things version)](images/Hitachi-wot-node-in-Node-RED.png)

- The program comsumes a Thing Description and generate a [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/)'s node.
- Installing the node to your Node-RED instance, you can handle Thing as a node in Node-RED.
  - The thing appears in Palette (left-side pane on editor screen).
    You can use node as a digital representation of physical asset.

### Usage

1. Retrieve a Thing Description (from Thing Directory, Mail, Web, etc.)

2. Generate a node module from the TD.

![Generate a node module from the TD](images/Hitachi-node-gen.png)

3. Install a node module to your Node-RED instance.

4. Start a Node-RED and create a flow using the node.  You can configure which action is invoked when message is received, etc.
