## To Consider
* Testing correct use of ontologies
    - iot:schema.org tooling â€“ shape tooling
    - Scope issue
* Interoperation tests
    - End-to-end semantics
* Security testing
    - Of a specific implementation
* Service testing
    - Discoverability
    - Directory
* Test Bed
    - Virtual devices, gateways, etc.
    - Perhaps derived from plugfest use cases
    - Integrated through W3C test frameworks
* Specification test tooling
    - W3C tools
    - Spectrack
